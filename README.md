Milestone 1 Project Overview: Building an E-commerce App with the MERN Stack

This project is a mentor-guided session focused on creating a complete e-commerce web application using the MERN stack. The goal is to gain practical experience in developing real-world web applications with features that are secure and scalable.

What is the MERN Stack?

The MERN stack is a popular technology set used to build full-stack web applications. It includes:
MongoDB – A database for storing data.
Express.js – A framework for building the backend.
React.js – A frontend library for creating user interfaces.
Node.js – A runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server.

The biggest advantage of the MERN stack is that it uses JavaScript for both the frontend and backend, making development easier and more beginner-friendly.

What is a REST API?

A REST API (Representational State Transfer) is a way for applications to communicate with each other over the web using standard HTTP methods such as:

GET – Retrieve data.
POST – Add new data.
PUT – Update existing data.
DELETE – Remove data.

Key Features of the Project

User Authentication:
> Allow new users to sign up.
> Enable existing users to log in securely.

Product Management:
> Add new products.
> Update product details.
> Get product information.

Order Handling:
> Manage customer orders.
> Provide well-structured data (usually in JSON format).

Basics of Database Schema Design:
Schema design in MongoDB involves organizing how data is stored and linked. This includes:
> Identifying important data types (e.g., Users, Products, Orders).
> Defining fields (e.g., name, price, email) and their data types.
> Linking data, such as connecting orders to specific users.

A well-designed schema ensures:
> Fast and efficient data retrieval.
> Easy scalability as the app grows.

Why is Authentication Important?

Authentication verifies a user's identity before allowing access to certain parts of the application. In our e-commerce app:
> Users log in securely.
> Only logged-in users can make purchases or view personal data like order history.

Key Benefits of Authentication:
> Keeps user information safe.
> Prevents unauthorized access.
> Offers a personalized experience for users.

By following these steps, we aim to build a reliable and secure e-commerce platform using the MERN stack.
